What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to make it easier for other developers to read the layout of the document. I found main, nav, header, and footer to be the most useful because they are very intuitive and easy to use.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The elements would be displayed in order from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned that snippets are an easy way to write sections of code without having to type everything out. I will definitely create more snippets at a later date.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The semantic tags were the most difficult part of the challenge for me. I can improve my understanding of this concept by using semantic tags more often in the future.
