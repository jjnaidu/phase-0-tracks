# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  
  Version control keeps track of the many versions of a software development project. It is useful because it records changes to files so the developer can go back and look at previous versions if there is a problem with the current version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  Branching creates a duplicate object under revision control so that different modifications can be made to each branch without affecting the other.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit saves the changes made to a file to the local repository. A good commit message provides a concise explanation of the changes made to the file since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict can occur when multiple people change the same file in a line, or if one user deletes a file and another user modifies it. Git marks the file as having a conflict, and then one user can resolve the conflict by changing a file in a way that ensures there are no conflicting edits.
