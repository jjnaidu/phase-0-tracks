* I will look up various resources on jQuery
* After a thorough cursory search, I will identify at least three resources I can look at in more depth
* I should stop and test what I learned whenever I try to implement a new concept into my project
* I should take short, periodic breaks in order to prevent myself from overworking

My strategy of searching for various resources, then narrowing it down worked well, because I was able to focus on the resources I chose without having to search for more information afterward. I was also able to manage my time well and finished without too much difficulty.
